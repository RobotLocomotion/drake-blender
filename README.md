# Overview

`drake-blender` is an implementation of the Drake
[glTF Render Client-Server API](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__render__engine__gltf__client__server__api.html)
atop
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

**This is a relatively new project and may still have bugs.
Please share your issues and improvements on GitHub.**

## Compatibility

This software is only tested on Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy", but should probably
work with any Python interpreter that supports our `requirements.txt`.

## Running the render server

There are two ways to run the server.

(1) From a git checkout of `drake-blender`:

```sh
./bazel run :server
```

This way has no extra setup steps. It will automatically download the required
dependencies into the Bazel sandbox, using the same versions as pinned by our
requirements lockfile that is tested in our Continuous Integration build.

(2) From your own virtual environment:

The `server.py` file is self-contained -- it does not import any other files
from drake-blender. Instead of using Bazel, you can also run it as a standalone
Python program (`python3 server.py`) so long as the packages listed in our
`requirements.in` are available in your Python runtime environment. You are
responsible for preparing and activating an appropriate virtual environment on
your own.

## Examples

See [examples](examples/README.md).

## Testing (for developers)

From a git checkout of `drake-blender`:

```sh
./bazel test //...
```

### Linting

Check for lint:

```sh
./bazel test //... --config=lint
```

Fix all lint:

```sh
./fix_lint.sh
```
