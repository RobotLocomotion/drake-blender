# Overview

`drake-blender` is an implementation of the Drake
[glTF Render Client-Server API](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__render__engine__gltf__client__server__api.html)
atop
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

**This is a relatively new project and may still have bugs.
Please share your issues and improvements on GitHub.**

## Compatibility

This software is only tested on Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy", but should probably
work with any Python interpreter that supports our `requirements.txt`.

## Running the render server

From a git checkout of `drake-blender`:

```sh
./bazel run :server
```

Note that `server.py` is self-contained. Instead of using Bazel, you can also
run it as a standalone Python program so long as the `requirements.in` packages
are available in your Python runtime environment.

## Examples

See [examples](examples/README.md).

## Testing (for developers)

From a git checkout of `drake-blender`:

```sh
./bazel test //...
```
